# Drawing app

[Go to live demo](https://drawing-app-flax.vercel.app/)

It is a simple application that allows the user to draw on the canvas using the mouse. The app allows to change brush size, its color. Change equipped item to rubber. User can also undo and redo drawn pictures and save it after work. Developing this application taught me how to use the canvas element in JavaScript and improved my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces.
